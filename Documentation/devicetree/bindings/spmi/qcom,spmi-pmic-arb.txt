Qualcomm SPMI Controller (PMIC Arbiter)

The SPMI PMIC Arbiter is found on the Snapdragon 800 Series.  It is an SPMI
controller with wrapping arbitration logic to allow for multiple on-chip
devices to control a single SPMI master.

The PMIC Arbiter can also act as an interrupt controller, providing interrupts
to slave devices.

See spmi.txt for the generic SPMI controller binding requirements for child
nodes.

Required properties:
- compatible : should be "qcom,spmi-pmic-arb".
- reg-names  : should be "core", "intr", "cnfg"
- reg : offset and length of the PMIC Arbiter Core register map.
- reg : offset and length of the PMIC Arbiter Interrupt controller register map.
- reg : offset and length of the PMIC Arbiter Configuration register map.
- #address-cells : must be set to 1
- #size-cells : must be set to 0
- interrupt-controller : indicates the PMIC arbiter is an interrupt controller
- #interrupt-cells = <4>:  interrupts are specified as a 4-tuple:
    cell 1: slave ID for the requested interrupt (0-15)
    cell 2: peripheral ID for requested interrupt (0-255)
    cell 3: the requested peripheral interrupt (0-7)
    cell 4: interrupt flags indicating level-sense information, as defined in
            dt-bindings/interrupt-controller/irq.h

Example:

	qcom,spmi@fc4c0000 {
		compatible = "qcom,spmi-pmic-arb";
		reg-names = "core", "intr", "cnfg";
		reg = <0xfc4cf000 0x1000>,
		      <0Xfc4cb000 0x1000>,
		      <0Xfc4ca000 0x1000>;
		#address-cells = <1>;
		#size-cells = <0>;

		interrupt-controller;
		#interrupt-cells = <4>;
	};
