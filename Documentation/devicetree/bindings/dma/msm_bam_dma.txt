MSM BAM DMA controller

Required properties:
- compatible: Should be "qcom,bam"
- reg: Address range for DMA registers
- interrupts: single interrupt for this controller
- #dma-cells: must be <3>
- clocks: required clock
- clock-names: name of clock

Example:

	dma0: dma@f9984000 = {
		compatible = "qcom,bam";
		reg = <0xf9984000 0x15000>;
		interrupts = <0 94 0>;
		clocks = <&bam_dma_ahb_cxc>;
		clock-names = "bam_clk";
		#dma-cells = <3>;
	};

Client:
Required properties:
- dmas: List of dma channel requests
- dma-names: Names of aforementioned requested channels

Clients must use the format described in the dma.txt file, using a four cell
specifier for each channel.

The four cells in order are:
  1. A phandle pointing to the DMA controller
  2. The channel number
  3. The execution environment value for this channel.
  4. Direction of the fixed unidirectional channel
     0 - Memory to Device
     1 - Device to Memory

Example:
	serial@f991e000 {
		compatible = "qcom,msm-uart";
		reg = <0xf991e000 0x1000>
			<0xf9944000 0x19000>;
		interrupts = <0 108 0>;
		clocks = <&blsp1_uart2_apps_cxc>, <&blsp1_ahb_cxc>;
		clock-names = "gsbi_uart_clk", "gsbi_pclk";

		dmas = <&dma0 0 0 1>, <&dma0 1 0 0>;
		dma-names = "rx", "tx";
	};
